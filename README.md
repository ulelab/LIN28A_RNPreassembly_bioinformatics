# About
This repository contains the source code used for bioinformatic analyses presented in the paper by Modic et al., 2024 "Poised PABP-RNA hubs implement signal-dependent mRNA decay in development".

In the analyses folder, the relevant code is deposited in numbered folders. When the scripts are executed in sequence indicated by the numbering, this reproduces the results presented in the paper.
Trained model to distinguish UP- from DOWN-regulated transcripts based on their 3'UTR nucleotide sequence is deposited in: /analysis/analysis13_MachineLearningOnQuantSeqGroups/Trained_Model.h5
